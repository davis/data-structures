#data-structures

This repo is an exploration of various data structures implemented in JavaScript, namely:

* Binary Search Tree
* Bloom Filter
* Graph
* Hashtable
* Linked List (singly and doubly-linked)
* Tree

The tests (running Mocha and Chai) can be found in test/.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.
